"""Volatility rotation, Treasuries, with a take profit: Swing High Breakout.

The highest high of the 240 bars (about nine sessions) before the current run is resistance. The target is 4 ATR past it, so the trade is held through the breakout and not sold into the resistance.

This is bots/vol_rotation/07_treasuries.py, the best of the ten on the
synthetic benchmark, with one change: a take-profit rule. While a trade is
above its average entry, only that rule can close it. The rotation,
distribution, momentum and volatility exits are ignored until the price falls
back under entry. The rules are in src/trading/take_profit.py.
