"""ASTRAL X2.10: NO MOMENTUM EXIT.

Losers are no longer closed when momentum turns, only by the stop, rotation
or distribution. The momentum exit closed about 50 trades in round x1 with a
2% win rate; this tests whether some of those would have recovered.

Built on astral_x1_no_crypto: the best of round x1 on the search window
(2026-07-06 to 2026-09-07): vt_basket without the crypto basket. Only what
is described above differs from the parent. See `run` in bots/astral.py. Not
in the village.
