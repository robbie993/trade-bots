"""ASTRAL X1.9: WIDER STOP.

The stop moves from 3 to 5 ATR, so 15-minute noise shakes out fewer trades
before they work.

Built on astral_vt_basket: the best strategy after six take-profit rounds,
which only moved the exit. Only what is described above differs from the
parent. See `run` in bots/astral.py. Not in the village.
